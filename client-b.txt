# ------------------------------------------------- #



To find the exit in a large warehouse in which the customer can move north, south, east or west

There are obstacles in the warehouse around which the customer has to negotiate


The warehouse is represented as a 2 dimensional grid and movements are completed in single steps in a direction on the x, y axis (north, south, east, west) 
	North (x, y+1) - moves up on the grid
	South (x, y-1) - moves down on the grid
	East (x+1, y) - moves right on the grid
	West (x-1, y) - moves left on the grid


The exit is at coordinates (4, 2)

Start (is a variable) is the position where the customer starts from in the warehouse

Visited (is a variable) will track positions in the warehouse where the customer has already been 
	visited coordinates are stored so that it's known where the customer has already been 

while the current position coordinates are not equal to the coordinates of the exit 
	the customer will move one step in a direction and update the current position coordinates 
		unless the step is blocked or 
		is a visited location or 
	this movement one step at a time will continue until the customer has located the exit
		if no steps are available to be taken, once the customer reaches a position, 
			the customer will return to the position from where they came and take a 			different directional step































The warehouse is setup in a grid with six zones that are labeled with letters

Zones A, D, E, H are all aisles at either the front of back of the store

The zones are located in alphabetical order in the store, two zones deep and three zones wide, going south to north and then west to east 

Items are organized by chronological numbers

An individual item can be located by the zone letter and a number

Each zone is separated by a 36" aisle to provide separation between zones

All customers start at the entrance which is by zone A and item number 0

Item number zero is the space in front of each zone that can be traversed by customers in a west to east movement



Program pseudocode:
The application has a title page introducing what is sold in the store

The title page has a text box into which the customer may enter the item they desire to locate

Computer searches zone/items array for the desired item

If the computer doesn't find the desired item in the array a message will be displayed stating that item is not available, enter a different item.

	This step repeats until an item is entered that is located in the zone/item array


Once the computer finds an item in the zone/item array it's location is mapped and directions to the items are displayed

The directions to the items are displayed in steps in chunks
	each set of chunks moves one direction (either north, south, east, west)
		once the customer has successfully moved the correct direction in a chunk the next chunk will display
